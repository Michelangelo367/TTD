Project-TTD Analysis
# In the TTD analysis i need to evalvuate the risk of each parameter comparing them with from inception to current data.
1, Need to understand the data and preprocess the data as per buisness requirement as it can be easily understand by anyone.
2,Need to write the code so that each parameter can be converted to vertical data shape as we need to compare 101 columns from inception to current.
3,The analysis is done on two level 
   1st one is Month on Month comparison from inception to current
   2nd one is Quarter to Quarter comparision from inception to current
   3rd one is Live Till Date to Live Till Date from inception to current.
4, As the company was a startup company we canot use any kind of paid softwares so came up with a idea where we can preprocess the data and convert it in to vertically and do risk analysis using Bounce as deliquency.
